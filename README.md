# Frogger-game

The frogger is game that aims to test your general focus levels. 
This is a time when games were mean't to be enjoyed, Arcade style. 

The programming langauge used was Javascript. 

The coding concepts used were as follows:
..............................................................................
.addEventListener()
.classList.add()
.classList.contain()
.classList.remove()
.forEach()
.querySelector()
.querySelectorAll()
.removeEventListener()
.textContent
clearInterval()
e.key
setInterval()
Switch()
................................................................................

Game components:
The game components that were considered within the functionality include:
-Logs
-Cars
-Frog

How it works:
Frogger needs to cross the busy road and strong river current, all in the hope of reaching the ending block in 20 seconds. 

1. The player will simply make use of the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the frog (which is located at the bottom-green block). 
2. The Frog will be tasked with passing a busy road. The black and grey blocks represent cars and road respectively. The frog will need to cross the road without being struck by the cars.
3. The Frog will then be tasked with passing a river. The brown and blue blocks would represent  logs and water respectively. The frog will need to hop onto the logs to make it to the other side of the river.
4. The frog will then need to make it's way to the red ending block. 

Launch:
Simply use Visual Studio Code or any HTML/JS/CSS compatible IDE(Integrated development environment) of your choice. 

The code was originally constructed by Ania Kub√≥w of Free code camp. This is used as a basepoint for future adaptions that I aim to make of this game.
